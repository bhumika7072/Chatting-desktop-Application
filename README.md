# Chatting-desktop-Application
A Chatting Desktop Application in Java is a real-time messaging system where users can communicate with each other via a desktop interface. The application is typically built using Javaâ€™s socket programming capabilities to establish communication between clients and a server, and often involves multi-threading to handle multiple users simultaneously.This project is a Desktop Chatting Application built using Java. It allows multiple users to communicate in real-time via a simple and user-friendly graphical interface (GUI). The application is designed to demonstrate network programming using sockets and multi-threading in Java.

Features
1. User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive desktop GUI for chatting.
2. Real-Time Messaging: Supports real-time communication between multiple users.
3. Server-Client Architecture: Uses a server to manage connections and relay messages to all clients.
4. Private Messaging: Option to send private messages to specific users.

How it Works
1. Server: Acts as a hub that manages multiple clients. It forwards messages from one client to others.
2. Client: The client connects to the server and sends/receives messages in real-time.
3. Private Messaging: Clients can direct messages to specific users by selecting their names.
4. Multi-Threading: Each client is handled by a separate thread, allowing simultaneous communication.
